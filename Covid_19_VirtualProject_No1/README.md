# Covid_19_VirtualProject_No1

Covid-19 (Coronavirus disease) is an infectious respiratory disease spread by droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes. My project defines the same.

#Interaction
<ul>
My program is interactive. I will include various coding data types to help create the following in my program. If the mouse is clicked, the person will cough (particle systems). As soon as he coughs, the virus particles on the screen will increase. This will allow the viewer to understand the importance of using tissues/covering your mouth when you sneeze/cough, therefore preventing in infectious droplets spreading from the individual. Secondly, if the space bar is presses, a sink will appear on the sneeze. It will look as though the person is washing their hands. Automatically, the virus particles will decrease, representing the prevention of spread of the virus.
