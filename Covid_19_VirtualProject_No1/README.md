# Covid_19_VirtualProject_No1

Covid-19 (Coronavirus disease) is an infectious respiratory disease spread by droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes. My project defines the same.

<h2>#Interaction</h2>
<ul>
My program is interactive. I will include various coding data types to help create the following in my program. If the mouse is clicked, the person will cough out droplets as a product (particle systems). As soon as he coughs, the user has to make sure to continously press the mouse so the virus particles on the screen will increase. This will allow the viewer to understand the importance of using tissues/covering your mouth when you sneeze/cough, and to wash your hands often, therefore preventing the infectious droplets spreading everywhere from the ill individual. Secondly, if the person goes in the boundaries of a sink (represents him washing his hands), automatically, the virus particles will stop getting added, representing the prevention of spread of the virus by simply maintaining basic hygiene.
